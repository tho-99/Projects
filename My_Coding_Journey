Day 1 of Recording my coding progress/journey

Hi!! I'm Tom, a recent university graduate from London

I have always been a very analytical person who loves problem solving and so wanted to take a bit of a risk in pursuing a career in a
sector that is worlds away from my degrees. I studied History and then International Relations on the basis that those were topics that I always loved 
growing up. Though interesting, it was not overly fulfilling writing essays about the wrongs of the past or the current world powers, so I wanted to change
career paths to one where my efforts and ideas can both help people as well as take advantage of such amazing technology

Since the start of the year I have switched my focus to breaking into a data science/analytics role in 2022. Ultimately, I would love to work in Sports and 
performance analytics for the teams I follow; I am also interested in building my own apps and games in order to show that learning to code/programme can 
be such an exciting journey.

This blog is almost 4 months in the making, as since January I have completed the Google Data Analytics course and begun learning about Data Science, at the
time of writing I have good knowledge of Python, SQL, Excel, R and a few others, but i am yet to comprehensively use them in my own projects, which is why I
have decided to start documenting my work/progress.

My page will be a real time tracker of how I progress with coding and my own projects over the nexet few months, until i get a job in the industry, at which
point I hope that I will be able to even continue talking about my work and the exciting projects I get to work on.

Let's get involved....
